# DSA-210-PROJECT

# Motivation
Having an insight into the features affecting rental prices, people would determine the house they rent in a more
cost-efficient way. By collecting proper and generalized information, I am going to strive to form an analogy between
the rental house prices and the elements that determine them. This analogy will contain structural features of the flat, the 
age of the building, the existence of a middleman, and the distance to the transportation centers.
My main purpose is to help a Sabancı University student find a suitable house in Kurtköy according to their budget by comparing and 
prioritizing these elements from different websites.

# Research Questions
How do structural features (apartment size in m², room count, number of bathrooms, floor) influence rent in Kurtköy?

How does proximity to transportation hubs (metro/bus stops, Sabiha Gökçen Airport) affect rental prices?

Do newer buildings have a higher price compared to old ones?

What is the effect of the furnishing on a flat?

How do listing channels and agents affect the price?
